##National Day of Civic Hacking 2013: 3D Printed Miami Median Income Census Data


###Background:
Following a discussion with Richard Bookman on the last day of the National Day of Civil Hacking in Miami, I was challenge to come up with 3D Printed sculpture of Census Data.

I elected the 2010 Median Household Income by zip code for Miami-Dade County. The range is quite substantial, from 19k all the way up to 138k. I originally planned on using 1mm per $1000 but that height exceeded my Printrbot Jr's build volume.

I'd like to thank Richard Bookman, Ernie Hsiung for their inspiration and support. Logan Powell, Timothy Gilbert, Jennifer Smits from the US Census Bureau for their assistance with this project.
